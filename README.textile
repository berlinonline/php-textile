h1. PHP-Textile website

This is the source code for the PHP-Textile website. This repository is powered by "Sculpin":https://sculpin.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ and "phpDocumentor":http://www.phpdoc.org/.

h2. Requirements

Building this repository requires:

* "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/ >=0.8.0
* "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ ~0.4.0
* "Composer":http://getcomposer.org/
* PHP >=5.6.0.

h2. Setup

h3. Installing required tools

The project uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/ to run tasks and "LESS":http://lesscss.org/ for CSS pre-processing. This creates few dependencies in addition to your normal PHP. First make sure you have base dependencies installed: "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/, "Bundler":http://bundler.io/, "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com/, "Bower":http://bower.io/ and "Composer":http://getcomposer.org/. Grunt and Bower can be installed using npm:

bc. $ npm install -g grunt-cli

h3. Installing dependencies

After you have the base dependencies taken care of, you can install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the project's directory, and run the dependency managers:

bc. $ npm install
$ composer install

h2. Building

This repository hosts sources and needs to be built before it can be used. After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, including building:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is either @test@, @build@ or @watch@. Watch will launch a task that watches for file changes. The project is automatically built if a source file is modified. The build task builds the project.
